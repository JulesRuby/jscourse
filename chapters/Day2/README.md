# Day 2

## Goals

Today, our goal is to make a site that can search for movies from a list of movies

## Technical things we need to learn to accomplish are goal

In order to do that, we will need to learn how to create resuable code using:

-   functions

And how to deal with complex data using data structures such as:

-   arrays
-   objects

And how to operate on those data structres using:

-   array methods
-   obhect methods
