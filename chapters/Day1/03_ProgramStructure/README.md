# 3. Program Structure

## Basic Intro (Demonstration)

-   just writing expressions is not enough. We need a way to organize our code
-   we need a way to control the flow of our code, and make decisions

## Chapter concepts overview (Demonstration)

### Giving things names (Variables)

-   why variables are good (giving data and procedures names is important, you are identifying intention)
-   comparing variables and expressions (are they the same?) - mention You Don't Know HS for more details

### functions

-   console.log()
-   prompt
-   return values
-   control flow (branchs, leading into if statements)

### Statements - If statements

-   how to bring logic into your program
-   if
-   if, else
-   if, if else, else
-   make sure to keep complexity low
-   nesting if statements is not great

### loops

-   do while

### Statements - For Loops

-   ++ and -- unurary expression and variable assignent
-   how to write a for loop (dont worry, there is a better way, it gets better)
-   how to break out of a loop

### Switch Statements

-   how to write a switch statement and break

### Comments
