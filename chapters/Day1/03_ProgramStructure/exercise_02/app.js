/**
 * Instructions
 *
 * Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid,
 * using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid
 * there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a
 * chessboard.
 *
 * Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
 * #_#_#_#_
 * _#_#_#_#
 * #_#_#_#_
 * _#_#_#_#
 * #_#_#_#_
 * _#_#_#_#
 *
 * When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8
 * and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of
 * the given width and height.
 *
