# Functions
A function is an action, is verbs in your program, the things you want your program to do. 

```js
function sayHello() {
  console.log('hello')
}

const sayHello = function() {
 console.log('hello')
}

const sayHello = () => console.log('hello')

```

Often functions need to be given something in order to do its job:
``` js
const announce = function(word) {
  console.log(word)
}

const announce = word => console.log(word)

```
