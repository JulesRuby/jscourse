## Chapter Exercises (In Class Work)

With console.log and variables (which we will go over in the next unit), create a Harry Potter
sorting hat. How it works:

-   prompt the user and ask them what their favorite color
-   ask what their favorite animal is
-   handle input that doesnt match any if statements
-   after two questions have been asked, console.log the house they belong to

For those who have never read Harry Potter, here is the answer key:

| House      | Color  | Animal |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ |
| Griffendor | Red    | Lion   |
| Ravenclaw  | Blue   | Raven  |
| Hufflepuff | Yellow | Badger |
| Slytherin  | Green  | Snake  |
