# Assignment #3 - JS App using an API

Here are the requirements:
- Project must get data from an API
- Project must show data from api on the page
- Project must include a click event

### The Purpose of this assignment
Along with confirming you know how to do the list of requirements above,
this assignment is purposely open ended so that you have room to build
something you will want to put on your portfolio in December. As
you plan what to build, think about what it is you want to show potential
employeers in an interview.

### Places to get data
- [Starwars API](https://swapi.co/)
- [Pokedex API](https://pokeapi.co/)
- [List of Public API's (may require API Keys)](https://public-apis.xyz/)
- Any other source you come across

### Here are some ideas:
- News Site
    - Use a news api (from public apis) to fetch news stories and display
      them on a page. Have categories at the top, which when clicked, will
      filter the news stories to that category.

- Starwars Dashboard
    - Make a dashboard that has a list of characters. When you click 
      on any of them, you fetch data for that item from the Star wars API
      and display it on the page.

- Pokedex
    - Using the pokedex api, make 2 pages. The first page will list all the
      pokemon. 
    - Have categories which when clicked, sort the pokemon by that category.
    - When clicking on any of the pokemon on the main page, you are taken to a second page, where you are given details on that individual pokemon. 
    - Here is an example of how that might work: [Pokedex](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/)

- Drink Menu
    - Using one of the drink api's from Public api's, have a page list all the
      drinks they have recipes for. When you click on any of them, you are taken to another page (or stay on the same page, which ever makes more
      sense based on your design) that shows how to make that individual drink.

### Advice
We always under estimate how long something will take. Its important to determine 2 things while planning your project:
- If I had all the time in the world, what would I ideally want to make
- What is the MVP (minumum viable product)

Ideal and MVP are not different projects, but different stages on the same project. Make sure to get the MVP done first. Reasons:
- If you get the MVP done before the deadline, you will have zero stress making it better (ui, design, added features), because all the requirements are met
- If you get the MVP done just in time, you will be really happy you didnt waste any time on non essential features.
