# Assignment #3 - JS App using an API

Here are the requirements:
- Project must get data from an API
- Project must show data from api on the page
- Project must include an event (click, key, setInterval, setTimeout)

### The Purpose of this assignment
Along with confirming you know how to do the list of requirements above,
this assignment is purposely open ended so that you have room to build
something you will want to put on your portfolio. The following API's
are available as choices:

### Places to get data
- [Starwars API](https://swapi.co/)
- [Pokedex API](https://pokeapi.co/)
- [Mock API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
- [Calgary API](https://data.calgary.ca/browse)


### Here are some ideas:
- Starwars Dashboard
    - Make a dashboard that has a list of characters. When you click 
      on any of them, you fetch data for that item from the Star wars API
      and display it on the page.

- Pokedex
    - Using the pokedex api, make 2 pages. The first page will list all the
      pokemon. 
    - Have categories which when clicked, sort the pokemon by that category.
    - When clicking on any of the pokemon on the main page, you are taken to a second page, where you are given details on that individual pokemon. 
    - Here is an example of how that might work: [Pokedex](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/)

- News Story Site
    - Using the Mock API, list all of the posts
    - When clicking on a post, you are taken to a 2nd page, which shows the post with all the related comments
    
- Visualize Calgary Data
    - Using the Calgary API, take 2 data sets and visualize them in a graph, comparing them and showing trends

### Advice
We always under estimate how long something will take. Its important to determine 2 things while planning your project:
- If I had all the time in the world, what would I ideally want to make
- What is the MVP (minumum viable product)

Ideal and MVP are not different projects, but different stages on the same project. Make sure to get the MVP done first. Reasons:
- If you get the MVP done before the deadline, you will have zero stress making it better (ui, design, added features), because all the requirements are met
- If you get the MVP done just in time, you will be really happy you didnt waste any time on non essential features.


### Where to find inspiration for design
Once you decide what kind of data you want to work with (Food, News, Weather), I would search for it on ta design site, for example:
- [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/)
- [UpLabs](https://www.uplabs.com/)
- [Adobe Behance](https://www.behance.net/)
