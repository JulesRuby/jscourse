# Assignment #1 - Adding Tiles

In this assignment, we are going to take an array of data and turn that into tiles on the index page.

## How will this be marked?

#### I will not mark your assignment until the following is true:
- Can I visit a github repo?
- Can I visit a url to see the final result?

#### Requirements
In order to get 90%, I will be asking the following questions
- Do the tiles match the data in the javascript file (1 point)
- Did your solution use a loop? (1 point)
- Did you use variables (1 point)
- Did you keep your code shallow (did you stay under 2 nested levels)

#### Over and Above
In order to get above 90%, you will need to do one of the following:
- change the grid tiles so it matches the inspiration img
- add background pictures to the tiles while still making sure the text is readable
